Fireballs and bolides are astronomical terms for exceptionally bright meteors that are visible enough to to be seen over a very wide area. Ground-based observers sometimes also witness these events at night, or much more rarely in daylight, as spectacular atmospheric light displays. This website is not meant to be a complete list of all fireball events; Only the brightest fireballs are noted.
Objects causing fireballs are usually not large enough to survive passage through the Earthâ€™s atmosphere intact, although fragments, or meteorites, are sometimes recovered on the ground. The approximate total radiated energy in the atmosphere is provided in unit of Joules, a unit of energy given in kilograms times velocity squared, or kg x (m/s)2. An event with an energy equivalent of one thousand tons of TNT explosives is termed a kiloton (kt) event, where 1 kt = 4.185 x 1012 Joules. In the Data Table, the total radiated energy is given but this is always less that the total impact energy. 
There are two different files with identical information-they only differ in amounts of data. After some data cleaning and data wrangling I created the second file and excluded everything except the "Time", "Date", "Calculated Impact Energy", and "Latitude" and "Longitude" columns for the sake of mapping that particular information.
